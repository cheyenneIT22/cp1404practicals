# Practical 07
# This Repo is a README file and a repo that explains about the lessons I have been Learning in this subject,
# and the information in the lessons.
# The first lesson I have learnt about "clean code" is that I have learnt how to properly name functions and make the code,
# more readable for the user.
# The second lesson I have learnt is that have a better and more in depth understanding of the Single Responsibility,
# principle and understand that each function is meant to do only one job.
# The third lesson I have learnt so far about clean code is properly implementing the (DRY) Don't Repeat Yourself principle,
# and that it is important to use code a single time and not reuse code in other parts of the program.
