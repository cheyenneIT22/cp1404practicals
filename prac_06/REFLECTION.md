# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have taken more time to practice the "Do this now" small programs in each week's content 
and I have taken note of specific parts of the content I will need to remember for the exam.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I personally need to give more time to reviewing the rest of the videos that are just the theory part as
I believe those videos are just as important as learning the code aspect of the subject.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

doing the activities both in class at the seminars as well doing small programs in my own time and doing,
the activities from the "Do this now" exercises.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I think I need to give more time to the assignments as I get so lost in one subject I Do not give myself enough to review
the requirements as that will ensure I improve and do well.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
The only request I would change is the amount of time we get on certain assignments depending on how big the assignment is
and what is expected of us within the assignment.
