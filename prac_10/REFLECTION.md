# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My initial estimates for task completion were less accurate than I had hoped, particularly when working on larger programs. 
I found that writing more complex code often took longer than expected due to the need for deeper problem-solving and debugging. 
This experience has highlighted the importance of factoring in additional time for testing and refining the code during my estimations. 
Moving forward, I aim to improve my time management by breaking down tasks into smaller components and allocating extra time for unexpected challenges

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over the course of the subject, my estimate accuracy improved significantly as I allocated more time to each task and practiced extensively. 
By rewriting code and attempting extension questions, I developed a better understanding of the effort required for different types of tasks. 
Additionally, creating my own programs allowed me to refine my problem-solving skills and gain a clearer perspective on how to break down and estimate the time needed for complex tasks. 
This iterative approach helped me become more confident and precise in planning and managing my work.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

From doing these estimates, I learned that they provide a clearer and more structured learning experience. 
Each time I write code or develop a program, 
the process highlights areas where I excel and aspects I can improve for the future.
This practice not only helps me identify my strengths and weaknesses but also fosters continuous improvement by encouraging reflection and refinement in my approach to problem-solving and coding.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
Being reviewed by others has taught me the value of gaining different perspectives on how people write their code and structure their programs. 
It has shown me that there is often more than one effective way to approach a problem. 
Receiving feedback on my code has helped me understand alternative approaches and best practices. 
When I gain insights from othersâ€™ suggestions, it boosts my confidence and motivates me to improve the structure and quality of my programs. 
These reviews have been instrumental in enhancing my coding skills and ensuring that my work is more organized and efficient.


### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
Additionally, providing feedback and suggestions to others feels rewarding, as it allows me to be helpful and encouraging. 
It reinforces the importance of collaboration, as offering constructive advice can help others improve their code, 
which in turn strengthens the overall quality of the project.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[https://github.com/ShutongChen9/cp1404practicals/pull/5]()

### Explanation
In this code review, I paid close attention to how the code was structured, particularly noting instances where lines were repeated. 
I suggested refactoring those parts to avoid redundancy and improve code efficiency. Additionally,
I recommended implementing error checking in certain areas to ensure the code handles potential issues more effectively. 
These suggestions were aimed at improving the overall readability, maintainability, and robustness of the code.

### Good Code Review 2

[https://github.com/JD-113/cp1404practicals/pull/5]()

### Explanation

For this code review, I did not have much to contribute as the code was spotless. 
The structure was well-organized, and there were no major issues or areas for improvement. 
Overall, the code demonstrated a high level of quality and attention to detail, making the review process straightforward.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge of the Programming II subject, one change I would consider is incorporating more hands-on, real-world projects that challenge students to apply the concepts in a practical setting. 
While the current curriculum provides a strong foundation, I believe students would benefit from having more opportunities to work on collaborative projects or client-based tasks. 
Additionally, I would introduce more structured time for peer code reviews, as this would allow students to learn from each other's approaches and improve their coding practices.
Finally, I would ensure that more time is dedicated to troubleshooting and debugging techniques, as these are crucial skills in software development.
Overall, focusing on practical application, collaboration, and problem-solving would enhance the learning experience and better prepare students for real-world programming challenges.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

In this subject, I did really well in incorporating clean code practices.
I made a conscious effort to apply principles such as writing functions that focus on a single task and structuring my code to enhance readability and maintainability. 
I also paid attention to using appropriate methods to organize my code effectively. 
This approach helped me understand the importance of clean code, especially when writing larger programs, and allowed me to produce more structured and understandable code overall.
